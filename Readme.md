# Motivation
## Reason for interest to develop this app
Over the period of last few years, I have developed interest over very diverse set of topics ranging from sports, history, technology,  economics, politics (state, national and geo). As a result of it, I have started following a lot of people in twitter. However, with the volume of tweets in my timeline, I am not able to follow all the tweets on a daily basis and it consumes a lot of time. 

In order to limit and optimize the time spent on reading all the tweets, I am looking to analyze the tweets in my timeline and bucket them in to different categories. So that I am hoping I will be able to peruse them in a quick manner

I have analyzed the market place for some app like this. All the Apps that I see are mostly about analyzing the followers count or some celebrity followers etc. 

### Disclaimer: I have never done any app development before. So let's see how far I could go with this project of mine!!!
